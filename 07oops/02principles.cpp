// Abstraction
  // 2 elements of programming
    // 1. Data

    // 2. Functions
  
  // You can use Classes for abstraction

// Encapsulation

  // Data Hiding

// Inheritance

// Polymorphism

// Differences between Classes and Objects

  // Class is a more overarching thing.
  // It's like how all bourbon is whiskey but not all whiskey is bourbon.
  // Whiskey is a class and Bourbon, Scotch, Irish are all objects of the class

  // Class has data and functions
